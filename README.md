# Random_Walk
An application for creating differrent kinds of random walk simulations.

Classes:

    Simulation:
    Sets up the simulation, handles saving data and adding the simulation objects

    Walker:
    The core of the simulation, an object that changes it's location in accordance with certtain rules

    Barrier:
    An object that denies passage to the walker.

    Portal:
    An object that teleports the walker to a certain place.

Features:

    Can aggragate the information from multiple simulations into an average result.
    Has a function for running an expirement and saving its result.

This is my final project in the Introduction to Computer Science course at HUJI.
