Random Walker Simulation!

Usage: 
[python main.py]  to open the GUI and start the simulation.
[python main.py <path>] to run the simulation from a specific JSON file.

Description:
The Random Walker Simulation program allows you to simulate the movement of random walkers in a two-dimensional space. The walkers move randomly in each step, and their positions are updated accordingly.

Command Line Arguments:
- <path> (optional): Specifies the path to a JSON file containing the initial configuration for the simulation. If not provided, the program will open a GUI.

JSON File Format:
JSON should be saved as <file_name>_simulation.json - WILL NOT RUN OTHERWISE
The JSON file should have the following structure:
{
  "Walkers":[{"movement": str, "color": str, "location": (float,float)}],
  "Barriers": [{"center": (float,float), "length": float, "angle": float}],
  "Portals": [{"center": (float,float), "endpoint": (float,float), "radius": float}],
  "Mudspots": [{"bottom_left": (float,float), "width": float, "height": float}],
  "Simulation": {"type": "graph", "gravity": int, "n": int, "iterations": int, "max_depth": int, "jumps": int, "filename": str} || {"type": "plot", "gravity": int, "n": int, "jumps": int, "filename": str}
}
NOTE DIFFERENCE  between two types of simulations


Example Usage:
1. To open the GUI and start the simulation:
    python main.py

2. To run the simulation from a specific JSON file:
    python main.py /path/to/config.json

Note: Make sure you have Python and all the requirements installed on your system before running the program.
