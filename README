# Random_Walk
An application for creating differrent kinds of random walk simulations.

Expansions:
    Has an extensive GUI allowing users to build a simulation manually, randomly or upload one from a *.json file - and view results.
    Option for a 3D simulation - all obstacles exist, including bi-polar gravity. Activated through the GUI, shows on new window.
    Allows for bi-polar gravity between walkers. Activated either through GUI or the json file.
    Has a class which generates graphs detailing the path a walker went through.
    Allows user to set (both GUI and json) a "reset constant" to randomly send walker to it's starting point
    Mudspots, rectangles where the walkers are "slowed down".
    Aditional class for generating random simulations
    Tests written >95% coverage (w/o GUI)
    Typing recieves no issues for "mypy ."



This is my final project in the Introduction to Computer Science course at HUJI.
